Hi, Iâ€™m a final-year B.Tech student passionate about learning and building through hands-on experience. I enjoy working on real-world problems using the skills Iâ€™ve picked up along the way whether it's coding, debugging, or presenting a project clearly.I believe in learning by doing, and I focus on writing clean, understandable code and presenting my work in a way thatâ€™s both simple and meaningful. Iâ€™ve worked on projects independently and in teams, and Iâ€™m always open to learning new tools or approaches that help me improve.
I may be a fresher, but I bring a lot of sincerity, curiosity, and readiness to grow.
